# Coffee Barber Shop

This is a web app developed with React. I started this project as a practise for what a real life app would be like.

# What have I learned from this project
By doing this app I've learned to create source code structures that is easier to manage. I've also learned to re-use code and enhance its readability. Working with this project teached me about hooks, React router, styled components and many other things.
